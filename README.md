<strong>#react-portfolio</strong>

<p>This link, <a href='https://alekszemz.github.io/react-portfolio/#/resume'>https://alekszemz.github.io/react-portfolio/#/resume</a>, directs to a personal portfolio website created by a developer named <strong>Alekszemz</strong>. The website is built using <strong>React.js</strong>, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>
<p>The portfolio website serves as a showcase for the developer's skills and experiences in web development. It provides a platform for the developer to display their work and highlight their abilities to potential employers and clients.</p>
<p>The link specifically navigates to the "Resume" page of the website, which is likely to include the developer's professional resume, as well as additional information about their education and work experience. The resume page may also include the developer's contact information and links to their other online profiles or projects.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning that the website is hosted on <strong>GitHub</strong>, which is a popular platform for hosting and sharing code and projects. By hosting the portfolio website on GitHub, the developer is able to share their work with a wider audience and also allows others to easily access the source code.</p>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
